## Challenge Description

I received this file from my boss's email, but when I opened it, suddenly all my files got encrypted and I got blackmailed :(((. At least please help me recover my files

## Solution

### Step 1: Cracking the Password for `Suspicious.zip`

The first challenge is to unlock the password-protected `Suspicious.zip`. We use **John the Ripper** to crack the password by first converting the ZIP file into a hash format with `zip2john`.

```bash
zip2john Suspicious.zip > out.hash
john out.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

The password-cracking process reveals the password as `infected`. Using this password, we can extract the contents of `Suspicious.zip`, which contains a file named `Important Data.docm`.

### Step 2: Analyzing `Important Data.docm`

`Important Data.docm` is a Microsoft Word document containing macros, which is often a sign of malicious activity. To safely examine the macros, we open the document in **safe mode**:

```bash
WIN + R: "winword /safe"
```

Next, we use the **Alt + F11** shortcut to open the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) editor and inspect the macro code. The macro downloads a PowerShell script from a **gist** and executes it:

```plaintext
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/daffainfo/20a7b18ee31bd6a22acd1a90c1c7acb9/raw/670f8d57403a02169d5e63e2f705bd4652781953/test.ps1
```

### Step 3: Understanding the PowerShell Script

The PowerShell script fetched by the macro performs encryption on the system files using AES-GCM with PKCS7 padding. The encryption key and IV (Initialization Vector) are handled within the script. Our objective is to reverse the encryption.

### Step 4: Decrypting the Files

The next step is to decrypt the encrypted file, `flag.zip.enc`. Based on the PowerShell script, we know that AES encryption with a CBC mode and PKCS7 padding was used. We write a Python script to handle the decryption.

The script defines a 256-bit key and a 128-bit IV, both derived from the analysis of the macro.

Here is the decryption script:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad

def decrypt_file(file_content, key, iv):
    # Create an AES cipher object with CBC mode
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    
    # Decrypt the data and unpad using PKCS7 padding
    decrypted_data = unpad(cipher.decrypt(file_content), AES.block_size, style='pkcs7')
    return decrypted_data

def main():
    key = bytes.fromhex('2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c762e7bf28d2cc54edbf1d1a55ae27e29')
    iv = bytes.fromhex('000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f')

    # Read the encrypted file content from a file
    with open("flag.zip.enc", "rb") as f:
        encrypted_file_content = f.read()

    # Decrypt the file
    try:
        decrypted_content = decrypt_file(encrypted_file_content, key, iv)
        print("Decryption successful.")
        
        # Save the decrypted content to a file
        with open("decrypted_flag.zip", "wb") as f:
            f.write(decrypted_content)
        print("Decrypted content saved to decrypted_flag.zip")

    except ValueError as e:
        print("Decryption failed:", str(e))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Running the decryption script successfully decrypts `flag.zip.enc` into `decrypted_flag.zip`.

### Step 5: Cracking `decrypted_flag.zip`

`decrypted_flag.zip` is also password-protected. Fortunately, we find another file in the extracted contents: `password.txt.enc`. Using the same decryption method as before, we decrypt `password.txt.enc` to reveal the message:

```plaintext
Password zip: Yayy__you_g0t_the_p4sSw0rd
```

Using this password, we unlock `decrypted_flag.zip`.

### Step 6: Retrieving the Flag

After unzipping `decrypted_flag.zip`, we obtain the flag file, which contains the final flag for the challenge.

## Conclusion

To summarize the steps we took:

1. We cracked the password-protected ZIP file using John the Ripper.
2. We analyzed a malicious macro script within a Microsoft Word document that downloaded a PowerShell script.
3. We decrypted AES-encrypted files by understanding the encryption mechanisms described in the PowerShell script.
4. We decrypted another password-protected ZIP file using the revealed password.
5. Finally, we retrieved the flag from the decrypted ZIP file.

By carefully following these steps, we were able to decrypt the contents and retrieve the flag.
